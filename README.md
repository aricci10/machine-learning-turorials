# Introduction

The objective of this tutorials is to build the mathematical intuition behind some of the most common Machine Learning algorithms. Each notebook contains some equations, commented code and interactive plots, aiming to maximise the comprenhension of the user. The notebooks are partly based on Andrew Ng's course (Especially the excercises), but I'm also taking ideas from other places, mainly Iain Murray's Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition course from The University of Edinburgh. (https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr/2018/notes/).

In order for the content to work correctly, please download the notebooks and run them locally. Also, be sure to have the important dpendencies intalled (see below).

# Notation

There are three important things to keep in mind about the notation I use. First, all vectors (unless specified otherwise) are _column vectors_. In this sense, if I want to refer to a row vector I will use the transpose of a column vector. Second, vectors are denoted using *bold* letters. Finally, matrices are denoted using capital letters.
